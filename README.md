The project leverages the JavaScript Canvas API to create a dynamic and interactive user interface for expression evaluation.

The application adheres to the requirement of not using any JavaScript frameworks or CSS frameworks.

The codebase is extensively documented to enhance readability and understanding for developers contributing to the project.

The project includes a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control, ensuring a clean repository.
